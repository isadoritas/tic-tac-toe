## Tic Tac Toe
This is a command-line version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using Ruby. The game can be played by two human players. The board is displayed after each turn.

# Installation

Navigate to the project directory.
Run ruby main.rb to start the game.
How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
Players take turns placing their marks on an empty cell.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all 9 cells are full and no player has won, the game is a tie.
